## Overview
![Travel_Partyrock1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0280574e-a171-4990-829a-a2267a61c45c) <br/>
I developed an AI Travel Assistant App using AWS PartyRock, designed to help users plan customized trips with ease <br/>
The app allows users to input essential travel details such as destination, travel duration, and specific interests (e.g., bakery tours), and in turn, it generates personalized travel itineraries <br/> 
Through intuitive widgets like text inputs for trip details and a chatbot for real-time interaction, users can receive tailored recommendations, such as the best bakeries in Paris <br/>
The app further enhances the user experience with image generation features to visually complement the suggested travel plans <br/>
 <br/>
Built entirely without writing code, this project leveraged AWS PartyRockâ€™s drag-and-drop functionality and easy-to-use interface, making it accessible for users without technical expertise <br/>
 <br/>
I gained the knowledge and skills necessary to develop this application during AWS Universe Day at AWS Korea Headquarters, hosted by Nxt Cloud <br/>
During this event, I learned how to effectively utilize PartyRock for building generative AI applications, enabling me to create this project from the ground up <br/>
